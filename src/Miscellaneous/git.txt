1 - We decided to remove some creepy old section from our Legacy application, but we didn't know a few co-workers still used it. In the meantime, someone deployed a few fixes to master. Now you have a worried Product Owner telling you to recover this old code. How would you do this with git commands?

    * git log --oneline --graph --decorate

     then choose the previous branch what you want

2 - A coworker convinced you of always using git from the console. You are making a commit and... Vim opens! The horror! You have written the commit message, but how do we save the file and exit Vim?

    * :q ->  save data and exit
      :q! -> discard data and exit

3 - We have two co-workers who have a strong opinion about git, one is a Merge fan and the other is a Rebase evangelizer. What is your opinion about Rebase and Merge?

    * Depends if you want to preserve the history and previous commits or not, you will use merge to keep and rebase to automerge but losing tracking
